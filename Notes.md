### React Fundaments

    React is a wrapper / component based UI library.
    Which means it will have wrappers/components in a child parent relationship.
    Twitter for example:
    App
        Navbar
        Profile
        Trends
        Feed
            Tweets
            Likes
            Comments

    A wrapper or a component is basically a class with some state and render option.

    eg:
        class Tweet {

            state = {};
            render(){

            }
        }

    State:
        A state is basically a virtual representation of a DOM
